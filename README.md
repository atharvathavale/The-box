**The Box - An Entertainment Website**

The box is a website designed by a team of 3 of us in which we have worked on our own spin of the popular website 'Bored Button'.
We have created a working login and registeration page, from which the user can click on a box and be redirected to various entertainment pages created by us for a lot of fun.
Using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React, Node and MongoDB, this is a full stack project to make an aesthetically pleasing website.
There are music, anime pages, drawing pad, fortune tellers and many more interesting pages that are waiting to be viewed.
Feel free to add more pages that could be added to it.

All HTML and JS codes are in the HTML_Codes file and all the JPEGs and PNGs are in their files respectively.
They all need to be in a single file so that they can be accessed by the code.
Do not change the name of the photos so that it is recognized by the HTML file.
You will have to run node serverdb.js to run the website on a local host and require MongoDB to be installed in your system.

A demo of how all the pages look are available in the Demo_Photos file!
You can download the zip file that contains everything.

We hope you love this project!
